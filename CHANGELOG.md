# Changelog

## [0.1.1]

- Update version number

## [0.1.0]

- Each task gets its own CLI agent working in a git worktree, so they can work in parallel on the same codebase without stepping on each other
- When an agent finishes, review diffs and leave comments before deciding what to merge
- Commit or open a PR directly from the board, and the agent writes the commit message or PR description for you
- Link tasks together to create dependency chains, where one task finishing kicks off the next, letting you complete large projects end to end
- "Automatically commit" and "automatically open PR" toggles give agents more autonomy to complete work on their own
- MCP integration lets agents add and start tasks on the board themselves, decomposing large work into parallelizable linked tasks
- Built-in git visualizer shows your branches and commit history so you can track the work your agents are doing
